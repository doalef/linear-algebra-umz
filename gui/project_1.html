					Gaussian Elimination (Project 1)

				<p class="subtitle is-6 subtitle-extras" class="">
					Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an
					algorithm in linear algebra for solving a system of linear
					equations. It is usually understood as a sequence of
					operations performed on the corresponding matrix of
					coefficients. This method can also be used to find the rank
					of a matrix, to calculate the determinant of a matrix, and
					to calculate the inverse of an invertible square matrix. The
					method is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855). Some
					special cases of the method - albeit presented without proof
					- were known to Chinese mathematicians as early as circa 179
					CE. To perform row reduction on a matrix, one uses a
					sequence of elementary row operations to modify the matrix
					until the lower left-hand corner of the matrix is filled
					with zeros, as much as possible. There are three types of
					elementary row operations: Swapping two rows, Multiplying a
					row by a nonzero number, Adding a multiple of one row to
					another row. Using these operations, a matrix can always be
					transformed into an upper triangular matrix, and in fact one
					that is in row echelon form. Once all of the leading
					coefficients (the leftmost nonzero entry in each row) are 1,
					and every column containing a leading coefficient has zeros
					elsewhere, the matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon
					form. This final form is unique; in other words, it is
					independent of the sequence of row operations used. For
					example, in the following sequence of row operations (where
					multiple elementary operations might be done at each step),
					the third and fourth matrices are the ones in row echelon
					form, and the final matrix is the unique reduced row echelon
					form. Using row operations to convert a matrix into reduced
					row echelon form is sometimes called Gauss–Jordan
					elimination. Some authors use the term Gaussian elimination
					to refer to the process until it has reached its upper
					triangular, or (unreduced) row echelon form. For
					computational reasons, when solving systems of linear
					equations, it is sometimes preferable to stop row operations
					before the matrix is completely reduced.
