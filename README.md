A minimal application for a series of projects for UMZ's Linear Algebra course by Prof. Valinejad,  created in a creative way for making python applications using Electron using HTML, JavaScript and CSS to make highly customized, cross platform desktop apps which uses native Python engine.


Note: This is for educational purposes only, this may not be efficient or bug-free. Also, this is the first time i'm testing out this approach so cut me some slacks :D

JS and Python can be used to interact together making handling data and interface separately and efficiently.
